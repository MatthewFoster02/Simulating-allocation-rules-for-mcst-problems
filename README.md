# MCST Games, generating problems and algorithms to find core allocations
This repository contains code for generating random graphs with different numbers of sources and players useful for MCST (minimum cost spanning tree) games. 
Different rules for games when there are exactly two sources are present. There is code to run the classical folk rule twice when an optimal solution has two components.
Reducing games to their irreducible form for calculating the Shapley value are also present. An adapted procedure for cases when all players want exactly one source is also presented.
