Sharing the cost of an edge.

TODOS:

Determine which state are we in;
    1. Both joining components have 0 sources, -> share proportionately
    2. 1 component has a source,
        a. Benficiaries in component without source -> Share evenly
        b. No beneficiaries -> Remove check paths
    3. Both components have a source,
        a. No beneficiaries -> Remove check paths
        b. One component has beneficiaries -> Share evenly
        c. Both components have beneficiaries -> Share proportionately
    4. 1 component has both sources. -> Share evenly

For the above examining the components that each end point is in, we can find these components easily - already done - but we then need to check
each component for sources and label the component somehow in order to determine which of the 4 above states we are in.

Take both components and return 1/2a/2b/3a/3b/3c/4
To do this inspect both components and check for source labels, determine from this appropriate response.
